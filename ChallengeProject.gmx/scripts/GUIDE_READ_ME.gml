/*
password_string has an array of ascii numbers
password numbers uses math to get the final numbers
email has words that create an email
read each create event and use the scripts to figure out what to do
write the code in the WRITE_CODE_HERE and run the game to test it
if the username works, a download link will show up on the screen

password_string uses fromArrayToString
email uses getEmail
for password_numbers, look at the hint (it's math time!)
numbers come after letters

set the username and password variables respectively in WRITE_CODE_HERE

once you're done, test it and see if a download button pops up, with the username and password in the corner.

if it works, call me over and I can set up a download for you at home!

good luck!
